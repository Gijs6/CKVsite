# My _CKV_-website

At my school, everyone has to make a website for the subject CKV (_culturele en kunstzinnige vorming_, so basically "culture and art") for all reports, reflections, and those kinds of things. The idea is to have a personal space everyone can update easily. Practically everyone just uses Wix because it's easy and requires no coding.

But I decided to build mine from scratch, because I like having full control over every detail. With Wix, you're stuck with whatever features they offer _(for free, I'm not paying! (...yeah I am paying for the hosting and the domain (well I already had a subscription to PythonAnywhere and I already had the domain, so I'm not really paying anything extra), but I'm not paying for features!!!))_, but by coding it myself, I can do literally everything to my liking (well, not _everything_, browsers still have their limits, but you can literally [run Linux __inside a PDF__ in a browser](https://github.com/ading2210/linuxpdf) (which is just genius), so definitely more than what Wix allows).

Built with [Flask](https://github.com/pallets/flask) and [Jinja](https://github.com/pallets/jinja) (yeah I like Flask, it is just simple but amazing)

Right now, I'm in the process of moving all my content from Wix to my new site, so writing all the HTML myself will take some time (on some of my page's on Wix I have over 2500 words with images and video's and audio and all kinds of styling).

So yeah, while everyone else is dragging and dropping elements in Wix, I'm over here figuring out Flask routes and Jinja templates and how I can fix one item not stretching with flex-grow when it's the only item on the row because of flex-wrap, but the other items do need to stretch <small>(if someone knows, please [email](mailto:gijs6@dupunkto.org) me)</small>. It will definitely take longer, and I will definitely be annoyed by some very stupid bugs, but it will feel at least  like my own website.
