# My own _CKV_ website

At my school, everyone has to make a website for the subject CKV (_culturele en kunstzinnige vorming_, so basically "culture and art") for all reports etc.
Practically everyone makes their website in Wix, but I wrote it myself, so I can just adjust literally everything.

Built with [Flask](https://github.com/pallets/flask) and [Jinja](https://github.com/pallets/jinja) (yeah I like Flask, it is just simple but amazing)

I'm in the process of moving my site from Wix to here, so it could take a while to build all the HTML myself.
