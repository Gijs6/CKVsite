# *CKV*-website

At my school, everyone has to make a website for the subject CKV (*culturele en kunstzinnige vorming*, so basically "
culture and art") for all reports, reflections, and those kinds of things. The idea is to have a personal space everyone
can update easily. Practically everyone just uses Wix because it's easy to use and requires no coding.

But I decided to build mine from scratch, because I like having full control over every detail. With Wix, you're stuck
with whatever features they offer *(for free, I'm not paying! (...yeah I am paying for the hosting and the domain (well
I already had a subscription to PythonAnywhere and I already had the domain, so I'm not really paying anything extra),
but I'm not paying for features!!!))*, but by coding it myself, I can do literally everything to my liking (well, not
*everything*, browsers still have their limits, but **definitely** more than what Wix allows).

So while everyone else is dragging and dropping in Wix and working with stupidly large margins, I'm over here figuring
out Flask routes and how to style an audio player and how I can fix one item not stretching with flex-grow when it's the
only item on the row because of flex-wrap, but the other items do need to stretch <small>(if someone knows,
please [mail](mailto:gijs6@dupunkto.org) me!)</small>. It will definitely take longer, and I will definitely be annoyed
by some very stupid bugs and some very annoying style stuff, but it will feel at least like my own website.

Built with [Flask](https://github.com/pallets/flask) and [Jinja](https://github.com/pallets/jinja) (yeah I like Flask,
it is just simple but amazing).

*Waarschijnlijk spreek je gewoon Nederlands en vraag je je af waarom dit in hemelsnaam in het Engels staat. Simpel: dat
is hier de norm. En jij begrijpt dit waarschijnlijk prima - terwijl je het eigenlijk niet eens **hoeft** te begrijpen.*
