# Style conventions  

*Just to make the website look a little less chaotic.*  

- Text describing the content of a page is in a **green** *kleurvak binnen-buiten*.  
- Border-radius is **20px**.  
- Use alt text in the format *artwork* - *artist* for artworks, or otherwise provide a short descriptive text.  
- `ckvbasis.css` contains only styles that are used across multiple pages.  
- Place styles in the CSS file where they are loaded on as few pages as necessary.  
- Artwork titles have a font-weight of **500**, and artist names are **800**.  
- All text that is **not** an artist's name or artwork title (within an artwork's description) is *italic*.  
- The two rules above apply only to text **directly related** to an artwork (near a video, image, audio, ...). In other cases, all names (both artwork and artist) are *italic*.  
- All elements inside the `content`-div are in `<div>`'s with the class `"paginablok"`.  
- The *paginablok* for *Kleine verklaring & uitleg* is in a **red** *kleurvak binnen-buiten*.
